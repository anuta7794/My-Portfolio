Welcome to my first Power BI portfolio project.
a.	Dataset.
The dataset used for this analysis report covers the most famous ski resorts in the world with all range of features critical for industry evaluation.

b.	Visualization Creation Process. 
I started the analysis off with General Geographic Overview. Then, I divided the data into three reports - Area and Facility Analysis, Customer Service Analysis, Activity and Entertainment Analysis.

General Geographic Overview is an introduction to the data that conveys some general background information on different ski resorts around the world. Looking at the map and “the biggest resorts” chart represents a big picture on the topic before going into details.

Area and Facility Analysis is intended to establish and evaluate relations between resort’s rate and such metrics as number of lifts and cable cars, cross-country skiing, accommodation, orientation, etc. The data was narrowed down to Colorado ski resorts. 

Customer Service Analysis is looking into the target audience and cleanliness measures focusing on Europe continent.

Activity and Entertainment Analysis examines such metrics as mountain restaurants, apres-ski, snow parks, etc using North America example.

c. Analysis Results.
According to this analysis and the insights, such attributes as ski infrastructure, cusomer-oriented service environment, gastronomy, and post-ski activities influence ski resort development and are positively related to a ski resort’s demand and revenue. In the first place, ski resort businesses should concentrate on the key service quality metrics such as variety of slopes, number of lifts and cable cars, and accomodation options to achieve maximum performance. However, it is also essential that businesses understand skiers’ behavior and make use of segmentation techniques in order to provide a more appropriate service to specific groups like families with kids, beginners, advanced skiers, etc. It is necessary to provide more deailed information about ski resort’ facilities, skill knowledge, and a general introduction for first-time skiers. Special attention should be given to the snow condition. Skiers, especially in off seasons, do not mainly aim at skiing but pay more attention to other factors, such as eating options, apres-ski and other activities. Therefore, ski resort managers should understand skier’s food preferences and offer more gastronomic options as well as non-ski activities.
